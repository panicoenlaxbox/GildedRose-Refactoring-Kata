# Refactoring Katas

Can you refactor? In really small steps? Can you turn some, frankly, ugly code into a paradigm of elegant, readable, extensible design?

This is a collection of starting files for when practicing refactoring.

Contents so far:

- Tennis Kata in Java, Python and C++.
- Gilded Rose Kata in C++, C#, Java, Python, Smalltalk, C and Ruby. (a C# version together with a starting project is already available on github [here](https://github.com/NotMyself/GildedRose))
- Yahtzee Kata in C#, Java, C++ and Python (the C#, C++ and Java versions are also available in Jon Jagger's Cyberdojo, see [his blog post](http://jonjagger.blogspot.co.uk/2012/05/yahtzee-cyber-dojo-refactoring-in-java.html))
