The command "make" will build and run your tests, as well as build the program
golden_rose, which can serve as the basis for a golden-rule test.


Assumptions:
  - gnu make and a C compiler (like gcc) is installed on your system and is in the PATH
  - The check unit testing library is installed on your system (https://libcheck.github.io/check/)
  - pkg-config is installed on your system

Notes:
  - This project is tweaked to run on Linux systems, and will mostly work on Macs.
    With some changes to the Makefile it can be made to run on BSD systems with
    BSD make.  An adventurous person could also get it to run on Windows.
  - If you are working on a Macintosh computer you cannot run the memtest target,
    because valgrind and OS X don't play nice any more.  If you want to use the
    memory checker OS X does run docker as a first class citizen.
  - If you don't have pkg-config on your system, the only changes you'll need to
    make are for the requirements of the check library.  Mostly you need to
    set the appropriate flags for threaded binaries, which may include some
    special linker flags.  The libcheck documentation will cover what you need
    if you want to undertake this change.
